        Acquire and clean user choice from POST

        Open specified log file with read permissions for parsing
        
        Parse IP - Byte combinations to array with IP key and Byte value pairs
        
        Only retain successful transmission (2xx status code)

        If bytes transmitted is null, set to zero

        Aggregate bytes for repeated IP addresses
