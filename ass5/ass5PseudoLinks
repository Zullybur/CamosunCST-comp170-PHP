QUESTIONS:
   Q: Why is the 'include' file is not in the public_html directory?
      A: 'Hiding' the file higher in the directory tree makes it harder
         for 'bad people' to access it. The higher you go in the tree the
         more permissions are needed to see and access files. Files in the
         public_html directory are easily accessible.

   Q: Do the queries work in Oracle SQL or SQL/92 or both?
      A: Oracle SQL queries using outer join notation (+)
         do not appear to be supported by MySQL. Different
         syntax is required for MySQL, so these queries have
         been removed from the code below.
